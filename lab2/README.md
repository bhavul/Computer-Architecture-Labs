Lab 2 - 8bit Shifter and ALU
====================

This contains the verilog code for a working 8 bit shifter with an ALU. 

The 8-bit shifter supports the following operations : 
1. Arithmetic Shift Right
2. Logical Shift Right
3. Circular Shift Right
4. Logical Shift Left
5. Circular Shift Left
6. No Shift

The ALU supports the following operations:
1. Zero
2. Addition
3. Subtract
4. And
5. Or
6. Negation

The pdf serves as a better Readme with a diagram as well as notations of modules implemented in the code.
