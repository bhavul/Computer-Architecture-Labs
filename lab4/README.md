Lab 4 - Basic Pipelined ARM Architecture implementation
====================

This lab contains the verilog code written to emulate a pipeline implementation with 16bit instructions. 

The supported instructions are:
1. lw
2. sw
3. addi
4. add
5. sub

The pdf serves as a better Readme with a schematic diagram as well as notations of modules implemented in the code.
